This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Supabase draft storage

To enable draft persistence for the admin blog editor, run the SQL script in `supabase/sql/create_blog_drafts.sql` against your Supabase project's database. This creates the `blog_drafts` table and supporting indexes/triggers. After running the migration, ensure the authenticated role has insert/update/delete/select access to the table for your admin users.

Once the table is in place, administrators can manage drafts from `/admin/drafts` (list, continue editing, or delete) and continue working on a draft by visiting `/admin/create`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
